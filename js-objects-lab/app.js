Exercise 3
1. Add a new property to the `game` object. Let's call it "difficulty".
2. Choose a value for "difficulty" that you think fits the game. Ex: "Easy", "Med" or "Hard". How would you assign it?


Solve Exercise 3 here:
*/

console.log(game);

/*
Exercise 4
1. Select a starter Pokémon from the `pokemon` array. Remember, a starter Pokémon's `starter` property is true.
2. Add this Pokémon to the `game.party` array. Which array method will you use to add them?

game.party.push(starterPoke[0]);


/*
Exercise 5
1. Choose three more Pokémon from the `pokemon` array and add them to your party.
2. Consider different attributes like 'type' or 'HP' for your selection. Which array method will you use to add them?

        break;
    }
}

console.log(game);


/*
Exercise 6
1. Set the `completed` property to true for gyms with a difficulty below 3.
2. Think about how you'd loop through the `gyms` array to check and update the `completed` property.

/*
Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. 
When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for 
replacing one element with another.

/*
Exercise 8
1. Print the name of each Pokémon in your party.
2. Consider using a loop or an array method to access each Pokémon's name.

Solve Exercise 8 here:
*/

game.party.forEach((poke) => {
    console.log(poke.name);
});


/*
Exercise 9
1. Can you print out all the starter Pokémon from the `pokemon` array?
2. Think about how you can identify a starter Pokémon and then log their names.


Solve Exercise 9 here:
*/

// starter poke array is already defined above

starterPoke.forEach((poke) => {
    console.log(poke);
});

/*
Exercise 10
Create a method called `catchPokemon` and add it to the `game` object. You should not need to edit the original game object directly. This method should:
  - Accept an object as a parameter called `pokemonObj`
  - Add the `pokemonObj` to the `game.party` array.
  - not return anything

After writing this method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
