Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. 
When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for 
replacing one element with another.

Exercise 10
Create a method called `catchPokemon` and add it to the `game` object. 
You should not need to edit the original game object directly. This method should:
  - Accept an object as a parameter called `pokemonObj`
  - Add the `pokemonObj` to the `game.party` array.
  - not return anything

After writing this method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Exercise 11
1. Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. Modify it so that it also decreases the number of pokeballs in your inventory each time you catch a Pokémon.
2. How will you find and update the quantity of pokeballs in the `game.items` array?

Tips:
For this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.
After updating the method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

/*
Exercise 13
1. Create a `gymStatus` method in `game` to tally completed and incomplete gyms.
2. How will you iterate through the `gyms` array and update the tally? Remember to log the final tally.

This method should:
  - Not accept any arguments.
  - Initially create a constant `gymTally`, which is an object that has two 
    properties: `completed` and `incomplete`, both of which are initially set to 0.
  - Iterate through the objects in the `game.gyms` array and update the 
    properties on `gymTally` as follows: 
    - `completed` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of `true` 
      for their `completed` property. 
    - `incomplete` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of 
      `false` for their `completed` property.
  - Log the value of `gymTally`.
  - The method should not return anything.

For example, if five gym objects have a value of `true` on their `completed` property and three gym objects have a value of `false` on their `completed` property, the logged value would be: `{ completed: 5, incomplete: 3 }`.

Exercise 14
1. Add a `partyCount` method to `game` that counts the number of Pokémon in your party.
