"""
As a user (AAU), I want to see a welcome message at the start of a game.

AAU, before being prompted for a move, I want to see the board printed 
in the console to know what moves have been made.

AAU, at the beginning of each turn, told whose turn it is: It’s player X’s turn!

AAU, I should be prompted to enter a move and be provided an example of valid 
input ('Enter a valid move (example: A1)').

AAU, I want to be able to enter my move’s column letter in upper or lower 
case (a/A, b/B, or c/C) to make it easier to enter my move.

AAU, if I enter a move in an invalid format or try to occupy a cell already 
taken, I want to see a message chastising me and be re-prompted.

AAU, after entering a move, I should once again be presented with the updated 
game board, notified of the current turn, and asked to enter a move for the 
other player. This process should continue until there is a winner or a tie

AAU, I should see a message at the end of the game indicating the winner or 
stating that the game ended in a tie.
